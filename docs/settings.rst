Settings
========

Our configurations are all namespaced under the ``OAUTH2_PROVIDER`` settings, with the exception
of the `List of non-namespaced settings`_.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    OAUTH2_PROVIDER = {
        'SCOPES': {
            'read': 'Read scope',
            'write': 'Write scope',
        },

        'CLIENT_ID_GENERATOR_CLASS': 'oauth2_provider.generators.ClientIdGenerator',

    }


A big *thank you* to the guys from Django REST Framework for inspiring this.

The namespaced ``OAUTH2_PROVIDER`` settings are grouped below by the OAuth2/OIDC
role they configure, so related knobs sit together:

* **Core / shared settings** — server plumbing, scopes, and swappable
  models/admin used across every role.
* **Authorization Server settings** — the provider side: issuing
  authorization/tokens, client registration, grant behavior, the RFC 9700 gates,
  and RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata.
* **OpenID Connect Provider settings** — the OIDC identity layer on top of the
  Authorization Server (ID tokens, discovery, JWKS, userinfo, and the
  RP-Initiated Registration/Logout endpoints that serve external relying
  parties). This library is the OpenID Provider, not a relying party/client.
* **Resource Server settings** — validating bearer tokens via remote
  introspection (RFC 7662) and advertising RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata.

Core / shared settings
----------------------

OAUTH2_SERVER_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string for the ``server_class`` (or ``oauthlib.oauth2.Server`` subclass)
used in the ``OAuthLibMixin`` that implements OAuth2 grant types. It defaults
to ``oauthlib.oauth2.Server``, except when :doc:`oidc` is enabled, when the
default is ``oauthlib.openid.Server``.

When ``OIDC_ENABLED`` is ``True`` and ``OAUTH2_SERVER_CLASS`` is not explicitly
configured, ``OIDC_SERVER_CLASS`` is used as the fallback.

OAUTH2_VALIDATOR_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the ``oauthlib.oauth2.RequestValidator`` subclass that
validates every step of the OAuth2 process.

OAUTH2_BACKEND_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string for the ``oauthlib_backend_class`` used by the view mixins, to get a
``Server`` instance. Defaults to
``oauth2_provider.core.backends_oauthlib.OAuthLibCore``, which reads request bodies as
``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` as required by the OAuth specifications.
(The pre-4.0 alias ``oauth2_provider.oauth2_backends.OAuthLibCore`` still resolves but is
deprecated.)

.. note::
    The ``oauth2_provider.core.backends_oauthlib.JSONOAuthLibCore`` backend value is deprecated
    (since 3.4.1) and will be removed in 4.0. It makes the OAuth token, introspection, and
    revocation endpoints
    read ``application/json`` request bodies, but those endpoints are defined to use
    ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` (RFC 6749, RFC 7662, RFC 7009). The JSON mode is
    non-standard and breaks interoperability with spec-compliant clients; every client can
    send a form-encoded body, so it provides no capability that the default backend lacks.
    Set `REQUIRE_FORM_ENCODED_REQUEST_BODY`_ to reject the non-standard bodies outright
    rather than misreporting them as a missing parameter.

EXTRA_SERVER_KWARGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A dictionary to be passed to oauthlib's Server class. Three options
are natively supported: token_expires_in, token_generator,
refresh_token_generator. There's no extra processing so callables (every one
of those three can be a callable) must be passed here directly and classes
must be instantiated (callables should accept request as their only argument).

Values given here override the ones django-oauth-toolkit derives from its own
settings, so ``token_expires_in`` set here takes precedence over
`ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS`_. Prefer that setting -- it accepts a callable too, is
validated, and is honored on every code path that computes a token's expiry.

SCOPES_BACKEND_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**New in 0.12.0**. The import string for the scopes backend class.
Defaults to ``oauth2_provider.core.scopes.SettingsScopes``, which reads scopes through the settings defined below.
(The pre-4.0 alias ``oauth2_provider.scopes.SettingsScopes`` still resolves but is deprecated.)
See :ref:`custom-scopes-backend` for how to write your own backend (for example to store scopes in the
database).

SCOPES
~~~~~~
.. note:: (0.12.0+) Only used if ``SCOPES_BACKEND_CLASS`` is set to the SettingsScopes default.

A dictionary mapping each scope name to its human description.

.. _settings_default_scopes:

DEFAULT_SCOPES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. note:: (0.12.0+) Only used if ``SCOPES_BACKEND_CLASS`` is set to the SettingsScopes default.

A list of scopes that should be returned by default.
This is a subset of the keys of the ``SCOPES`` setting.
By default this is set to ``'__all__'`` meaning that the whole set of ``SCOPES`` will be returned.

.. code-block:: python

  DEFAULT_SCOPES = ['read', 'write']

READ_SCOPE
~~~~~~~~~~
The name of the *read* scope. Unlike ``SCOPES``/``DEFAULT_SCOPES``, this is used regardless of
``SCOPES_BACKEND_CLASS`` -- the read/write permission helpers (``TokenHasReadWriteScope``,
``TokenHasResourceScope``, ``rw_protected_resource``, ``ReadWriteScopedResourceMixin``) read it
directly from settings. A custom scopes backend must therefore expose a scope with this name from
``get_available_scopes()`` so a token can actually be granted it (requested scopes are validated
against ``get_available_scopes()``; see ``OAuth2Validator.validate_scopes``). ``rw_protected_resource``
and ``ReadWriteScopedResourceMixin`` additionally require it to be in ``get_all_scopes()`` and raise
``ImproperlyConfigured`` otherwise (see :ref:`custom-scopes-backend`).

WRITE_SCOPE
~~~~~~~~~~~
The name of the *write* scope. Like ``READ_SCOPE``, this is used regardless of
``SCOPES_BACKEND_CLASS`` by the read/write permission helpers, so a custom scopes backend must
expose a scope with this name from ``get_available_scopes()`` (so it can be granted) and, for
``rw_protected_resource`` / ``ReadWriteScopedResourceMixin``, from ``get_all_scopes()`` (see
:ref:`custom-scopes-backend`).

GRANT_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your grants. Overwrite
this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.Grant``).

APPLICATION_ADMIN_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your application admin class.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.admin.ApplicationAdmin``).

ACCESS_TOKEN_ADMIN_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your access token admin class.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.admin.AccessTokenAdmin``).

GRANT_ADMIN_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your grant admin class.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.admin.GrantAdmin``).

REFRESH_TOKEN_ADMIN_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your refresh token admin class.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.admin.RefreshTokenAdmin``).

CLEAR_EXPIRED_TOKENS_BATCH_SIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``10000``

The size of delete batches used by ``cleartokens`` management command.

CLEAR_EXPIRED_TOKENS_BATCH_INTERVAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``0``

Time of sleep in seconds used by ``cleartokens`` management command between batch deletions.

Set this to a non-zero value (e.g. ``0.1``) to add a pause between batch sizes to reduce system
load when clearing large batches of expired tokens.

Authorization Server settings
-----------------------------

CLIENT_ID_GENERATOR_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class responsible for generating client identifiers.
These are usually random strings.

CLIENT_SECRET_GENERATOR_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class responsible for generating client secrets.
These are usually random strings.

CLIENT_SECRET_GENERATOR_LENGTH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The length of the generated secrets, in characters. If this value is too low,
secrets may become subject to bruteforce guessing.

CLIENT_SECRET_HASHER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The hasher for storing generated secrets. By default library will use the first hasher in PASSWORD_HASHERS.

ACCESS_TOKEN_GENERATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Import path of a callable used to generate access tokens.
``oauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.tokens.random_token_generator`` is (normally) used if not provided.

REFRESH_TOKEN_GENERATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See `ACCESS_TOKEN_GENERATOR`_. This is the same but for refresh tokens.
Defaults to access token generator if not provided.

.. _settings_access_token_expire_seconds:

ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``36000``

How long an access token remains valid. Requesting a protected resource after this
duration will fail. Keep this value high enough so clients can cache the token for a
reasonable amount of time.

Accepted values:

* an ``int`` (or ``float``) number of seconds;
* a ``datetime.timedelta``;
* a callable taking the current ``oauthlib.common.Request`` and returning either of
  the above, so the lifetime can vary per client, grant type, scope or session;
* a dotted import path to such a callable, e.g. ``"myapp.oauth.access_token_expires_in"``
  -- useful because a Django settings module often cannot import a callable that touches
  models at settings-load time.

The resolved value drives both the ``expires_in`` member of the token response and the
stored ``AccessToken.expires``, so the two always agree. A static value must be
positive; a misconfigured one is reported at startup as ``oauth2_provider.E006``.

See :ref:`dynamic_access_token_lifetime` for worked examples, and note that
`EXTRA_SERVER_KWARGS`_ ``["token_expires_in"]``, if set, overrides this setting.

AUTHORIZATION_CODE_EXPIRE_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``60``

The number of seconds an authorization code remains valid. Requesting an access
token after this duration will fail. :rfc:`4.1.2` recommends expire after a short lifetime,
with 10 minutes (600 seconds) being the maximum acceptable.

REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How long a refresh token remains valid. Can be an ``Int`` or ``datetime.timedelta``.
Defaults to ``None``, which means refresh tokens never expire (they last until
revoked or rotated).

Expiry is **idle-based**: a refresh token is rejected ``REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS``
after its paired access token expires. Because the access token's expiry advances
every time the refresh token is used, an actively-used refresh token keeps sliding
forward and never expires on its own; only a refresh token that has been dormant for
longer than ``REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS`` past its last access token's expiry is
rejected.

When set, this is enforced in two places:

* at validation time -- a refresh token past its lifetime is rejected when presented,
  regardless of whether ``cleartokens`` has run; and
* by the ``cleartokens`` management command, which deletes expired refresh tokens from
  the database (see the :ref:`cleartokens` management command).

A value of ``0`` (or ``datetime.timedelta(0)``) is treated the same as ``None`` --
expiry is disabled -- consistent with ``cleartokens``.

.. note::
   Deployments that already set ``REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS`` should be aware that,
   as of the release that introduced validation-time enforcement, refresh tokens that
   are already past their configured lifetime are rejected on their next use, which may
   force affected clients to re-authenticate.

.. note::
   **Security guidance.** Refresh-token rotation (``ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN``, on by default)
   is the primary defense against a leaked refresh token; see :doc:`security`. As
   additional defense-in-depth, consider setting a finite ``REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS``
   so a refresh token that leaks and is then left idle cannot be redeemed indefinitely.
   The default ``None`` places no upper bound on an idle refresh token's lifetime.

REFRESH_TOKEN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The number of seconds a refresh token can still be used after it has been
revoked, for example because it was consumed by refresh token rotation. The
most common use case is native mobile applications that run into issues of
network connectivity during the refresh cycle and are unable to complete the
full request/response life cycle. Without a grace period the app has only a
consumed refresh token and the only recourse is to have the user
re-authenticate. A suggested value, if this is enabled, is 2 minutes. The
value must not be negative.

The ``cleartokens`` management command removes revoked refresh tokens once the
grace period has passed, unless ``REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION`` is enabled.
Check :ref:`cleartokens` management command for further info.

The grace period only ever shields a refresh token that a rotation *superseded* — the
token a client retries when it did not receive the rotated response. A refresh token that
was deliberately revoked (through the ``/revoke/`` endpoint, the admin, RP-initiated
logout, or by revoking its access token) is rejected immediately, whatever the grace
period: :rfc:`7009#section-2.1` requires that a revoked token "cannot be used again after
the revocation". The same applies to a token that has already been rotated past — see
``REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION`` below.

With ``ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN`` disabled nothing supersedes a refresh token, so the grace
period has no effect: the same token stays valid until it is revoked or expires.

REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When this is set to ``True`` (default ``False``), and ``ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN`` is used, the server will check
if a previously, already revoked refresh token is used a second time. If it detects a reuse, it will automatically
revoke all related refresh tokens.
A reused refresh token indicates a breach. Since the server can't determine which request came from the legitimate
user and which from an attacker, it will end the session for both. The user is required to perform a new login.

Can be used in combination with ``REFRESH_TOKEN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS``

The family is revoked as a set, by ``RefreshToken.revoke_family()``, in a fixed number of
queries however large the family is. This matters because a rotating session keeps every
refresh token it has ever been issued in the same family: the family only grows, and a
client that keeps replaying the same stale token pays for the sweep on every request.
``token_family`` is indexed for this. If you swap in your own refresh token model, run
``makemigrations`` to pick up that index, and if you override ``revoke()`` override
``revoke_family()`` to match, so both paths revoke a token the same way.

This requires ``ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN``: replay is detected by recognizing a token that a
previous rotation superseded, and without rotation nothing ever does. Enabling reuse
protection while rotation is off raises the ``oauth2_provider.W012`` system check.

More details at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-29#name-recommendations

ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When is set to ``True`` (default) a new refresh token is issued to the client when the client refreshes an access token.
If ``False``, it will reuse the same refresh token and only update the access token with a new token value.
See also: validator's rotate_refresh_token method can be overridden to make this variable
(could be usable with expiring refresh tokens, in particular, so that they are rotated
when close to expiration, theoretically).

ERROR_RESPONSE_WITH_SCOPES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When authorization fails due to insufficient scopes include the required scopes in the response.
Only applicable when used with `Django REST Framework <http://django-rest-framework.org/>`_

REQUEST_APPROVAL_PROMPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can be ``'force'`` or ``'auto'``.
The strategy used to display the authorization form. Refer to :ref:`skip-auth-form`.

ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEMES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``["http", "https"]``

A list of schemes that the ``redirect_uri`` field will be validated against.
Setting this to ``["https"]`` only in production is strongly recommended.

For Native Apps the ``http`` scheme can be safely used with loopback addresses in the
Application (``[::1]`` or ``127.0.0.1``). In this case the ``redirect_uri`` can be
configured without explicit port specification, so that the Application accepts randomly
assigned ports.

Note that you may override ``Application.get_allowed_schemes()`` to set this on
a per-application basis. For policy a static list cannot express -- schemes held in the database,
a blacklist, or review-gated approval -- replace the validator itself; see
``REDIRECT_URI_VALIDATOR`` below.

Native apps using an RFC 8252 §7.1 private-use URI scheme should add that scheme here
(e.g. ``["https", "com.example.app"]``) and register the redirect URI in the single-slash
form the RFC prescribes, ``com.example.app:/oauth2redirect``. A private-use scheme has no
naming authority, so the single-slash and double-slash spellings are *different* URIs and
are not interchangeable at request time. The redundant ``com.example.app:///oauth2redirect``
and the rootless ``com.example.app:oauth2redirect`` are rejected. Schemes that require an
authority (``http``, ``https``, ``ws``, ``wss``, ``ftp``) must still include a host.

ALLOWED_SCHEMES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``["https"]``

A list of schemes that the ``allowed_origins`` field will be validated against.
Setting this to ``["https"]`` only in production is strongly recommended.
Adding ``"http"`` to the list is considered to be safe only for local development and testing.
Note that `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT <https://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2/security.html#envvar-OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT>`_
environment variable should be also set to allow HTTP origins.

For origin policy a static list cannot express, replace the validator itself; see
``ALLOWED_ORIGIN_VALIDATOR`` below.

ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

SECURITY WARNING: Enabling this setting can introduce security vulnerabilities. Only enable
this setting if you understand the risks. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2
states "The redirection endpoint URI MUST be an absolute URI as defined by [RFC3986] Section 4.3." The
intent of the URI restrictions is to prevent open redirects and phishing attacks. If you do enable this
ensure that the wildcards restrict URIs to resources under your control. You are strongly encouraged not
to use this feature in production.

When set to ``True``, the server will allow wildcard characters in the domains for allowed_origins and
redirect_uris.

``*`` is the only wildcard character allowed.

``*`` can only be used as a prefix to a domain, must be the first character in
the domain, and cannot be in the top or second level domain.  Matching is done using an
endsWith check.

For example,
``https://*.example.com`` is allowed,
``https://*.sub.example.com`` is allowed,
``https://*-myproject.example.com`` is allowed,
``https://*--sitename.netlify.app`` is allowed for Netlify deploy previews,
``https://*.com`` is not allowed, and
``https://example.*.com`` is not allowed.

Single-dash patterns such as ``https://*-sitename.netlify.app`` are syntactically allowed for
backward compatibility, but they are unsafe for Netlify because they can match unrelated hosts such
as ``something-sitename.netlify.app``. Use the double-dash form for Netlify deploy previews.

This feature is useful for working with CI service such as cloudflare, netlify, and vercel that offer branch
deployments for development previews and user acceptance testing.

REDIRECT_URI_VALIDATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``"oauth2_provider.validators.default_redirect_uri_validator"``

A callable that builds the validator applied to each entry in an application's ``redirect_uris``
when the application is validated. Use it for redirect-uri policy that a static scheme list cannot
express -- schemes stored in the database, a blacklist, or a scheme accepted only once the client
has been reviewed.

The setting names a *factory*, not the validator itself. It is called with the application and
returns a callable that takes one URI string and raises
:class:`~django.core.exceptions.ValidationError` when the URI is unacceptable::

    factory(application) -> callable(uri)

``Application.clean()`` calls the factory **once per validation pass**, so a factory backed by the
database queries once per save rather than once per URI. The application may be unsaved
(``pk is None``) when it is registered through Dynamic Client Registration (:rfc:`7591`),
:doc:`CIMD <cimd>` or the admin add form, so a factory must not assume its reverse relations exist.

A class is a callable too, so a validator can subclass ``oauth2_provider.validators.AllowedURIValidator``
and take the application in ``__init__``, inheriting all of its :rfc:`3986` / :rfc:`8252` parsing::

    from oauth2_provider.validators import AllowedURIValidator

    class DBSchemeValidator(AllowedURIValidator):
        def __init__(self, application):
            schemes = list(application.approved_schemes.values_list("scheme", flat=True))
            super().__init__(schemes, name="redirect uri", allow_path=True, allow_query=True)

    OAUTH2_PROVIDER = {
        "REDIRECT_URI_VALIDATOR": "myapp.validators.DBSchemeValidator",
    }

To set the policy per application instead of server-wide, override
``Application.get_redirect_uri_validator()`` on a :ref:`swapped application model
<custom-uri-validators>`.

Unlike ``RESOURCE_SERVER_TOKEN_RESOURCE_VALIDATOR``, this setting may **not** be ``None``: skipping
redirect-uri validation entirely is an open-redirect risk, so an empty value raises at first access.
A deliberate no-op is still available, spelled explicitly as a factory returning ``lambda uri: None``.

.. warning::
    This gates what may be **stored**, not what is accepted at request time. An incoming
    ``redirect_uri`` is still matched against the stored values by exact string comparison per
    :rfc:`9700` section 2.1, which no validator here can relax -- a validator that permits a sloppy
    URI merely stores a value that never matches.

    Conversely, permitting a new **scheme** here is not enough on its own: the scheme is separately
    gated at request time by ``Application.get_allowed_schemes()`` (see
    ``ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEMES`` above), so a URI accepted here can still be refused when the
    redirect is issued. Widen both, and remember that widening the accepted set widens the
    open-redirect and phishing surface.

    The :rfc:`9700` deploy checks ``W008`` and ``W009`` read ``ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEMES`` and
    ``ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS`` statically, so they cannot see through a custom validator and may both
    false-positive and false-negative. A custom validator owns its own :rfc:`9700` section 2.1 posture.

    On the Dynamic Client Registration and CIMD paths the validator is the *only* check on redirect
    uri syntax, and its message is surfaced verbatim to the registering client in
    ``error_description``. Write client-facing messages there.

ALLOWED_ORIGIN_VALIDATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``"oauth2_provider.validators.default_allowed_origin_validator"``

A callable that builds the validator applied to each entry in an application's ``allowed_origins``.
It follows exactly the same factory contract as ``REDIRECT_URI_VALIDATOR`` above, including the
prohibition on ``None``, and is overridable per application as
``Application.get_allowed_origin_validator()``.

.. warning::
    As above, this gates only what may be stored. An origin whose scheme is outside
    ``ALLOWED_SCHEMES`` is still rejected at request time by ``is_origin_allowed()``, so a custom
    validator that permits one must widen ``ALLOWED_SCHEMES`` too.

ALLOW_LOCALHOST_LOOPBACK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

`RFC 8252 section 7.3 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252#section-7.3>`_ requires the
authorization server to accept any port on a loopback ``redirect_uri`` at request time, so a native
app can bind whatever ephemeral port the OS assigns. The toolkit applies that exemption to the loopback
IP literals ``127.0.0.1`` and ``[::1]`` unconditionally. `Section 8.3
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252#section-8.3>`_ notes that ``localhost`` redirect URIs
"function similarly" but that their use is NOT RECOMMENDED, so ``localhost`` is *not* granted the
any-port exemption by default.

Some native clients nonetheless register ``http://localhost/callback`` and then receive the callback on
an ephemeral port. When set to ``True``, the ``http://localhost`` hostname is treated as loopback and
granted the same any-port exemption as the IP literals. The hostname must still match exactly, so
``localhost`` is never conflated with ``127.0.0.1`` / ``[::1]``, and scheme, path, and query matching
are unchanged.

SECURITY WARNING: Per RFC 8252 section 8.3, prefer registering the loopback IP literals over
``localhost``: a ``localhost`` redirect can resolve to a non-loopback interface on a host with
misconfigured name resolution, whereas ``127.0.0.1`` / ``[::1]`` cannot. Only enable this if you must
support clients that register ``localhost``.

PKCE_REQUIRED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``True``

Can be either a bool or a callable that takes a client id and returns a bool.

Whether or not `Proof Key for Code Exchange <https://oauth.net/2/pkce/>`_ is required.

According to `OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice <https://oauth.net/2/oauth-best-practice/>`_ related to the
`Authorization Code Grant <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#section-2.1.>`_

- Public clients MUST use PKCE `RFC7636 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636>`_
- For confidential clients, the use of PKCE `RFC7636 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636>`_ is RECOMMENDED.

REQUIRE_FORM_ENCODED_REQUEST_BODY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

When ``True``, a POST to an endpoint that takes the parameters making up the request in an
``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` body is answered with ``415 Unsupported Media Type`` and an
``invalid_request`` error unless it is sent with that media type. It covers the token
(:rfc:`4.1.3`, :rfc:`4.3.2`, :rfc:`4.4.2` and :rfc:`6`), revocation (`RFC 7009 section 2.1
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009#section-2.1>`_), introspection
(`RFC 7662 section 2.1 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.1>`_), device
authorization (`RFC 8628 section 3.1
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628#section-3.1>`_) and pushed authorization request
(`RFC 9126 section 2.1 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126#section-2.1>`_) endpoints.

Media type parameters are ignored, so ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8`` is
accepted. ``GET`` requests are never affected: the introspection endpoint, the only covered one
that accepts a ``GET``, takes its parameters from the query string there.

Some endpoints are deliberately *not* covered. Dynamic Client Registration takes
``application/json`` bodies per `RFC 7591 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591>`_. The
OpenID Connect UserInfo endpoint accepts a POST whose only credential is the ``Authorization``
header (`OpenID Connect Core section 5.3.1
<https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo>`_); the form-encoding
requirement of `RFC 6750 section 2.2
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-2.2>`_ is a condition on a client putting
the access token *in the body*, not a constraint on the endpoint. Your own protected resources
are likewise untouched.

.. deprecated:: 3.5
    The ``False`` default is deprecated and is scheduled to become ``True`` in 4.0. Until then
    a non-compliant body is still passed through, but every one emits a ``DeprecationWarning``
    and an ``oauth2_provider`` logger warning naming the change to come. Nothing is emitted for
    a compliant request, so a deployment whose clients already send form-encoded bodies stays
    quiet -- and for it the coming default flip is a no-op. Set the setting to ``True`` to adopt
    the behavior now and silence the warnings.

The default is ``False`` because turning enforcement on rejects two kinds of request that
previously worked:

* ``application/json`` bodies, read by the deprecated ``JSONOAuthLibCore`` value of
  `OAUTH2_BACKEND_CLASS`_. Combining that backend with this setting rejects every request
  before the backend can parse it, so ``manage.py check`` raises ``oauth2_provider.E006``.
* ``multipart/form-data`` bodies. No specification permits them here, but Django parses them
  into ``request.POST`` so they have always worked -- including from Django's own test client,
  whose ``client.post(url, data={...})`` sends multipart unless a ``content_type`` is passed.
  If your test suite posts to these endpoints that way, it is the source of the warnings, and
  it will need a ``content_type`` before 4.0.

While enforcement is off, a request sent with any other media type reaches the view with no
parameters at all (Django only populates ``request.POST`` for form-encoded and multipart
bodies), which surfaces as a misleading error about a parameter the client did send -- a JSON
token request, for instance, is rejected as ``unsupported_grant_type``.

PAR_ENABLED
~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``True``

Whether the `RFC 9126 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9126>`_ Pushed Authorization Request
endpoint (``par/``) accepts requests and is advertised in the server metadata document. See
:doc:`pushed_authorization_requests`.

PAR_REQUEST_URI_LIFETIME_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``60``

The lifetime, in seconds, of a ``request_uri`` issued by the PAR endpoint. RFC 9126 §2.2 suggests a
relatively short value (typically between 5 and 600 seconds).

REQUIRE_PUSHED_AUTHORIZATION_REQUESTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

When ``True``, the authorization endpoint only accepts requests that were pushed to the PAR
endpoint (i.e. that carry a ``request_uri``), and the metadata document advertises
``require_pushed_authorization_requests``. Enforcement can also be required per client via the
application's ``require_pushed_authorization_requests`` field; the server-wide setting is a floor
that a per-client value never relaxes.

JWT_BEARER_GRANT_ENABLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

Enable the RFC 7523 §2.1 JWT bearer authorization grant
(``urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer``) at the token endpoint. When
enabled, the grant identifier is added to ``grant_types_supported`` in the RFC
8414 metadata. See :doc:`jwt_bearer_grant`.

JWT_BEARER_SUBJECT_RESOLVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``"oauth2_provider.authorization_server.rfc7523.resolve_subject_by_username"``

Import string for the callable ``resolver(claims, application, request) -> User
| None`` that maps a validated assertion's ``sub`` claim to a Django user. The
default matches ``sub`` against the user model's ``USERNAME_FIELD`` (active,
non-privileged users only). Returning ``None`` rejects the request.

JWT_BEARER_ALLOW_PRIVILEGED_SUBJECTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

When ``False`` (the default), the built-in subject resolver refuses ``sub``
claims that map to a privileged account (``is_staff`` or ``is_superuser``): an
assertion mints a token for its subject without that user's interactive consent,
so an admin must not be impersonable by default. Set to ``True`` to allow
privileged subjects — only with another authorization control in place (e.g. a
custom resolver enforcing a per-client actor→subject allow-list). Has no effect
when a custom ``JWT_BEARER_SUBJECT_RESOLVER`` is configured.

JWT_BEARER_TRUSTED_ISSUERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``{}``

Mapping of trusted third-party issuer (``iss``) to its key configuration, e.g.
``{"https://sts.example.com": {"jwks_uri": "https://sts.example.com/jwks.json"}}``
or ``{"https://sts.example.com": {"jwks": {"keys": [...]}}}``. Used for assertions
not issued by the client itself.

JWT_BEARER_AUDIENCES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``[]``

Extra ``aud`` values accepted in an assertion, in addition to the OIDC issuer and
the derived token endpoint URL. Set this explicitly behind a TLS-terminating
proxy.

JWT_BEARER_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

Whether the jwt-bearer grant issues a refresh token. Off by default; clients are
expected to present a fresh assertion instead.

JWT_BEARER_MAX_ASSERTION_LIFETIME_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``3600``

Reject an assertion whose ``exp`` is further than this many seconds in the
future, bounding the replay window.

JWT_BEARER_REQUIRE_JTI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``True``

Require the assertion to carry a ``jti`` claim (needed for replay protection).

.. note::
   The jwt-bearer grant reuses the shared ``CLIENT_ASSERTION_LEEWAY`` and
   ``CLIENT_ASSERTION_JWKS_*`` settings (documented above) for clock-skew leeway
   and JWK Set fetching, and the default Django cache for ``jti`` replay
   detection.

RFC 9700 gates (``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_*``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of these booleans covers one `RFC 9700 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700>`_
(OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice) recommendation: ``True`` enforces the
compliant behavior, ``False`` (the current default) preserves the legacy behavior. The
request-time gates emit a ``DeprecationWarning`` each time the discouraged behavior is
used while the gate is ``False``; the two ambient gates
(``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_AUTHZ_RESPONSE_ISS`` and ``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_TOKEN_STORAGE``)
would fire on every request and are instead surfaced by ``manage.py check --deploy``.
The defaults are scheduled to flip to ``True`` in the 4.0 release. See :doc:`security`
for the full mapping and a copy/paste compliant settings block.

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_IMPLICIT_GRANT``
    Default: ``False``. When ``True``, the implicit grant (``token`` / ``id_token``
    response types) is rejected and no longer advertised (RFC 9700 §2.1.2).

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_PASSWORD_GRANT``
    Default: ``False``. When ``True``, the resource owner password credentials grant
    is rejected and no longer advertised (RFC 9700 §2.4).

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_PKCE_METHOD``
    Default: ``False``. When ``True``, the PKCE ``plain`` ``code_challenge_method`` is
    rejected and dropped from metadata; only ``S256`` is accepted (RFC 9700 §2.1.1).

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_ACCESS_TOKEN_TRANSPORT``
    Default: ``False``. When ``True``, access tokens presented in the URI query
    string are rejected at the resource server (RFC 9700 §4.3.2).

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_AUTHZ_RESPONSE_ISS``
    Default: ``False``. When ``True``, the
    `RFC 9207 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9207>`_ ``iss`` parameter is
    added to the authorization response and advertised in metadata (RFC 9700 §4.4).

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_TOKEN_STORAGE``
    Default: ``False``. When ``True``, access and refresh tokens are stored hashed
    rather than in cleartext (RFC 9700 §4). Incompatible with a non-zero
    ``REFRESH_TOKEN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS`` (``manage.py check --deploy`` raises
    ``oauth2_provider.E001``).

The remaining gates are *config-validation* gates: they do not change runtime behavior
or replace the settings they cover — the canonical setting stays in control. They set
the severity of the ``manage.py check --deploy`` message when the covered setting is on
a non-compliant value: ``False`` (default) → Warning, ``True`` → Error.

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_REFRESH_TOKEN``
    Default: ``False``. Flags ``REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION = False``
    (RFC 9700 §4.14.2) as ``W007`` / ``E002``.

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEME``
    Default: ``False``. Flags ``"http"`` in ``ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URI_SCHEMES``
    (RFC 9700 §2.1) as ``W008`` / ``E003``.

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_REDIRECT_URI_MATCHING``
    Default: ``False``. Flags ``ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS = True`` (RFC 9700 §4.1.1) as
    ``W009`` / ``E004``.

``COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_PKCE_REQUIRED``
    Default: ``False``. Flags ``PKCE_REQUIRED = False`` (RFC 9700 §2.1.1) as ``W010`` /
    ``E005``. A callable ``PKCE_REQUIRED`` (per-client policy) is not flagged.

OAUTH2_RESPONSE_TYPES_SUPPORTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``["code", "token"]``

The response types advertised by the :doc:`oauth2_server_metadata` endpoint.

OAUTH2_GRANT_TYPES_SUPPORTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default::

    [
        "authorization_code",
        "implicit",
        "password",
        "client_credentials",
        "refresh_token",
        "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code",
    ]

The grant types advertised by the :doc:`oauth2_server_metadata` endpoint.

OAUTH2_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHODS_SUPPORTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``["client_secret_post", "client_secret_basic"]``

The token endpoint authentication methods advertised by the :doc:`oauth2_server_metadata` endpoint.
Add ``"private_key_jwt"`` and/or ``"client_secret_jwt"`` to advertise :doc:`RFC 7523 JWT client
authentication <rfc7523>`; the metadata document then also emits the matching
``*_auth_signing_alg_values_supported`` fields.

OpenID Connect Provider settings
--------------------------------

These settings configure the OpenID Connect Provider (OP) — the identity layer on
top of the Authorization Server. See :doc:`oidc` for the full guide.

OIDC_ENABLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

Whether or not :doc:`oidc` support is enabled.

OIDC_SERVER_CLASS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``"oauthlib.openid.Server"``

The import string for the OIDC ``server_class`` used when ``OIDC_ENABLED`` is
``True`` and ``OAUTH2_SERVER_CLASS`` is not explicitly configured.

OIDC_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

The RSA private key used to sign OIDC ID tokens. If not set, OIDC is disabled.

OIDC_RSA_PRIVATE_KEYS_INACTIVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``[]``

An array of *inactive* RSA private keys. These keys are not used to sign tokens,
but are published in the jwks_uri location.

This is useful for providing a smooth transition during key rotation.
``OIDC_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`` can be replaced, and recently decommissioned keys
should be retained in this inactive list.

OIDC_JWKS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``3600``

The max-age value for the Cache-Control header on jwks_uri.

This enables the verifier to safely cache the JWK Set and not have to re-download
the document for every token.

OIDC_USERINFO_ENDPOINT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

The url of the userinfo endpoint. Used to advertise the location of the
endpoint in the OIDC discovery metadata. Changing this does not change the URL
that ``django-oauth-toolkit`` adds for the userinfo endpoint, so if you change
this you must also provide the service at that endpoint.

If unset, the default location is used, eg if ``django-oauth-toolkit`` is
mounted at ``/o/``, it will be ``<server-address>/o/userinfo/``.

OIDC_USERINFO_CORS_ENABLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``True``

Whether the userinfo endpoint answers CORS preflight (``OPTIONS``) requests and sends
``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`` on its responses, so browser-based (JavaScript) clients can
call it cross-origin without extra middleware. `OpenID Connect Core 1.0 section 5.3
<https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo>`_ says the endpoint SHOULD
support CORS.

The origin cannot be narrowed to the calling application's ``Allowed origins``: the preflight
request carries no access token, so there is no application to resolve at that point. The
wildcard is safe because claims are still only released to a caller holding a valid access
token, and ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`` is never sent, so browsers will not attach
ambient cookies to the request.

Set this to ``False`` to send no CORS headers from the userinfo endpoint at all, for instance if
you prefer to control them with CORS middleware such as `django-cors-headers
<https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers>`_. Note that when that middleware is
installed it answers every CORS preflight before any view runs, so the userinfo path has to be
allowed there too even when this setting is left on.

OIDC_ISS_ENDPOINT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

The URL of the issuer that is used in the ID token JWT and advertised in the
OIDC discovery metadata. Clients use this location to retrieve the OIDC
discovery metadata from ``OIDC_ISS_ENDPOINT`` +
``/.well-known/openid-configuration``.

If unset, the default location is used, eg if ``django-oauth-toolkit`` is
mounted at ``/o``, it will be ``<server-address>/o``.

OIDC_RESPONSE_TYPES_SUPPORTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default::

    [
        "code",
        "token",
        "id_token",
        "id_token token",
        "code token",
        "code id_token",
        "code id_token token",
    ]


The response types that are advertised to be supported by this server.

OIDC_SUBJECT_TYPES_SUPPORTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``["public"]``

The subject types that are advertised to be supported by this server.

OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHODS_SUPPORTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``["client_secret_post", "client_secret_basic"]``

The authentication methods that are advertised to be supported by this server. Add
``"private_key_jwt"`` and/or ``"client_secret_jwt"`` to advertise :doc:`RFC 7523 JWT client
authentication <rfc7523>`; the discovery document then also emits
``token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported``.

OIDC_RP_INITIATED_REGISTRATION_ENABLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

Whether to allow the Relying Party (RP) to direct a user to an OpenID
Provider (OP) to create a new account rather than authenticate with an
existing one, per `OpenID Connect Prompt Create 1.0
<https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-prompt-create-1_0.html>`_.
This is done by adding a ``prompt=create`` parameter to the
authorization request. When enabled,
``OIDC_RP_INITIATED_REGISTRATION_URL`` must also be set.

Only unauthenticated users are redirected to registration. For a user
with an existing authenticated session, ``create`` is a no-op and the
authorization request proceeds as if it was not present — matching how
major providers treat a signup hint alongside an active session. A
Relying Party that wants re-authentication instead can combine prompt
values, e.g. ``prompt=create login``.

OIDC_RP_INITIATED_REGISTRATION_URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``None``

Where users are sent to create an account when an authorization request
contains ``prompt=create``. Like ``LOGIN_URL``, the value is resolved with
:func:`django.shortcuts.resolve_url` and so accepts a URL pattern name, a
path, or an absolute URL. For example, with `django-allauth
<https://docs.allauth.org>`_::

    OAUTH2_PROVIDER = {
        # ...
        "OIDC_RP_INITIATED_REGISTRATION_ENABLED": True,
        "OIDC_RP_INITIATED_REGISTRATION_URL": "account_signup",
    }

The registration page receives a ``next`` query parameter pointing back to
the authorization endpoint, and must redirect the user there after a
successful registration so the OAuth flow can complete.

This setting is required when ``OIDC_RP_INITIATED_REGISTRATION_ENABLED`` is
``True``: if it is unset or cannot be resolved, ``ImproperlyConfigured`` is
raised when a ``prompt=create`` request is received.

OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_ENABLED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

When is set to ``False`` (default) the `OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html>`_
endpoint is not enabled. OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout enables an :term:`Client` (Relying Party)
to request that a :term:`Resource Owner` (End User) is logged out at the :term:`Authorization Server` (OpenID Provider).

OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_ALWAYS_PROMPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``True``

Whether to always prompt the :term:`Resource Owner` (End User) to confirm a logout requested by a
:term:`Client` (Relying Party). If it is disabled the :term:`Resource Owner` (End User) will only be prompted if required by the standard.

OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_STRICT_REDIRECT_URIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``False``

Enable this setting to require `https` in post logout redirect URIs. `http` is only allowed when a :term:`Client` is `confidential`.

OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_ACCEPT_EXPIRED_TOKENS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``True``

Whether expired ID tokens are accepted for RP-Initiated Logout. The token must still be
signed by the OP, carry a matching ``iss`` claim, and resolve to a stored ``IDToken``;
only the ``exp`` and ``nbf`` claims are skipped.

The default is ``True`` because `OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0
<https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html>`_ treats ``id_token_hint``
as a *previously issued* ID token, used only as a hint about which session to end. Logout
frequently happens long after the ID token's (typically short) ``exp``, so rejecting an
expired hint would break the normal logout flow. Set this to ``False`` if you additionally
want to require that the ``id_token_hint`` is still within its validity period.

OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_DELETE_TOKENS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``True``

Whether to delete the access, refresh and ID tokens of the user that is being logged out.
The types of applications for which tokens are deleted can be customized with ``RPInitiatedLogoutView.token_types_to_delete``.
The default is to delete the tokens of all applications if this flag is enabled.

Resource Server settings
------------------------

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The introspection endpoint for validating token remotely (RFC7662). This URL requires an
authorization token (``RESOURCE_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN``), HTTP Basic Auth client credentials
(``RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_CREDENTIALS``), or an RFC 7523 client assertion configuration
(``RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_*``).

RESOURCE_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The bearer token to authenticate the introspection request towards the introspection endpoint (RFC7662).

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_CREDENTIALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The HTTP Basic Auth Client_ID and Client_Secret to authenticate the introspection request
towards the introspect endpoint (RFC7662) as a tuple: ``(client_id, client_secret)``.

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_CLIENT_ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``None``

The client_id to authenticate the introspection request with an RFC 7523 ``private_key_jwt``
client assertion (see :doc:`rfc7523`). All of ``RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_CLIENT_ID``,
``RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`` and ``RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_AUDIENCE``
must be set; ``RESOURCE_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`` and ``RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_CREDENTIALS`` take
precedence when configured. A fresh assertion (new ``jti``, short expiry) is generated per request.

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``None``

The signing key for the introspection client assertion: a private-key PEM string or a JWK JSON
string.

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_AUDIENCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``None``

The ``aud`` claim for the introspection client assertion — the remote authorization server's
issuer or its introspection endpoint URL, per the remote server's policy.

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_ALG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``None``

The JWS algorithm for the introspection client assertion. ``None`` infers it from the key type
(RSA → ``RS256``, EC → ``ES256``/``ES384``/``ES512`` by curve).

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_LIFETIME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``60``

Lifetime in seconds of each generated introspection client assertion.

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_JWT_KID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``None``

Optional ``kid`` header for the introspection client assertion; defaults to the signing key's own
``kid`` when it has one.

RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``5``

The timeout in seconds for the HTTP request to the remote introspection endpoint. Every request
carrying a bearer token goes through this call when ``RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_URL`` is set, so
without a bound an authorization server that accepts the connection and then stalls would hold a
worker per inbound request. On timeout the token is treated as invalid, as for any other failed
introspection request.

RESOURCE_SERVER_TOKEN_CACHING_SECONDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The number of seconds an authorization token received from the introspection endpoint remains valid.
If the expire time of the received token is less than ``RESOURCE_SERVER_TOKEN_CACHING_SECONDS`` the expire time
will be used.

RESOURCE_SERVER_TOKEN_RESOURCE_VALIDATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``"oauth2_provider.resource_server.validators.validate_resource_as_url_prefix"``
(the pre-4.0 alias ``oauth2_provider.oauth2_validators.validate_resource_as_url_prefix`` still resolves).

A callable that validates whether an access token's audience (RFC 8707 resource indicators) matches
a request URI. The callable receives ``(request_uri, audiences)`` where ``request_uri`` is a string
and ``audiences`` is a list of audience URIs from the token. Returns ``True`` if the token
is authorized for the request, ``False`` otherwise.

The default validator uses **prefix matching**: a token with audience ``https://api.example.com/v1``
will accept requests to ``https://api.example.com/v1/users`` but reject ``https://api.example.com/v2``.

The default validator expects both the request URI and the audience values to be **absolute URIs
with a scheme and host**, without userinfo or fragment components, because it compares
``(scheme, host, port)`` and then the path. A query component is permitted on resource indicators
(RFC 8707 allows one) but plays no part in matching: the request URI is compared with its query
string stripped. Other absolute-URI forms, such as URNs, never match. Supporting them requires
both a custom validator here (for matching on the resource server) and a custom
``OAUTH2_VALIDATOR_CLASS`` overriding ``_validate_resource_uris()`` (the authorization server
rejects authority-less URIs at issuance).

To use exact matching instead:

.. code-block:: python

    def exact_match_validator(request_uri, audiences):
        if not audiences:
            return True  # Unrestricted token
        return request_uri in audiences

    OAUTH2_PROVIDER = {
        'RESOURCE_SERVER_TOKEN_RESOURCE_VALIDATOR': 'myapp.validators.exact_match_validator',
    }

Set to ``None`` to disable automatic audience validation entirely.

AUTHENTICATION_SERVER_EXP_TIME_ZONE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. deprecated:: 3.3.1
    This setting is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Token introspection ``exp`` (expiration) values are Unix timestamps and are interpreted as UTC per
:rfc:`7662` and :rfc:`7519`. For backwards compatibility, setting this to a non-UTC time zone keeps
the previous workaround behavior of reinterpreting the ``exp`` wall-clock time as being in the
configured time zone, but configuring it now emits a ``DeprecationWarning``.

OAUTH2_PROTECTED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

The ``resource`` identifier advertised by the :doc:`protected_resource_metadata`
endpoint. When empty it is derived from the request URL.

OAUTH2_PROTECTED_RESOURCE_AUTHORIZATION_SERVERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``[]``

The ``authorization_servers`` advertised by the :doc:`protected_resource_metadata`
endpoint. When empty, this server's own authorization-server issuer is used
(``OIDC_ISS_ENDPOINT`` or the RFC 8414 route).

OAUTH2_PROTECTED_RESOURCE_BEARER_METHODS_SUPPORTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``["header"]``

The ``bearer_methods_supported`` advertised by the :doc:`protected_resource_metadata`
endpoint.

OAUTH2_PROTECTED_RESOURCE_NAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

Human-readable ``resource_name`` advertised by the :doc:`protected_resource_metadata`
endpoint. Omitted from the document when empty.

OAUTH2_PROTECTED_RESOURCE_DOCUMENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

``resource_documentation`` URL advertised by the :doc:`protected_resource_metadata`
endpoint. Omitted from the document when empty.

OAUTH2_PROTECTED_RESOURCE_POLICY_URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

``resource_policy_uri`` URL advertised by the :doc:`protected_resource_metadata`
endpoint. Omitted from the document when empty.

OAUTH2_PROTECTED_RESOURCE_TOS_URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default: ``""``

``resource_tos_uri`` URL advertised by the :doc:`protected_resource_metadata`
endpoint. Omitted from the document when empty.

List of non-namespaced settings
-------------------------------
.. note::
   These settings must be set as top-level Django settings (outside of ``OAUTH2_PROVIDER``),
   because of the way Django currently implements swappable models.
   See `issue #90 <https://github.com/django-oauth/django-oauth-toolkit/issues/90>`_ for details.


OAUTH2_PROVIDER_ACCESS_TOKEN_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your access tokens.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.AccessToken``).

OAUTH2_PROVIDER_APPLICATION_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your applications.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.Application``).

OAUTH2_PROVIDER_ID_TOKEN_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your OpenID Connect ID Token.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.IDToken``).

OAUTH2_PROVIDER_GRANT_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your OAuth2 grants.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.Grant``).

OAUTH2_PROVIDER_DEVICE_GRANT_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your OAuth2 device grants.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.AbstractDeviceGrant``).

.. note:: ``device_code`` uniqueness is enforced by the named ``UniqueConstraint``
    ``<app_label>_<class>_unique_device_code`` inherited from
    ``AbstractDeviceGrant.Meta.constraints``. Do not add ``unique=True`` to the field in your
    swapped model: declaring both creates a duplicate unique index, which breaks ``migrate`` on
    Oracle (``ORA-02261``) and on MySQL backends that raise database warnings as errors
    (``ER_DUP_INDEX``).

OAUTH2_PROVIDER_REFRESH_TOKEN_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your refresh tokens.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.RefreshToken``).

OAUTH2_PROVIDER_PAR_REQUEST_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The import string of the class (model) representing your RFC 9126 pushed authorization requests.
Overwrite this value if you wrote your own implementation (subclass of
``oauth2_provider.models.AbstractPushedAuthorizationRequest``).

.. note:: ``request_uri`` uniqueness is enforced by the named ``UniqueConstraint``
    ``<app_label>_<class>_unique_request_uri`` inherited from
    ``AbstractPushedAuthorizationRequest.Meta.constraints``. Do not add ``unique=True`` to the field
    in your swapped model, for the same reason described under
    ``OAUTH2_PROVIDER_DEVICE_GRANT_MODEL``.

Settings imported from Django project
-------------------------------------

USE_TZ
~~~~~~
Used to determine whether or not to make token expire dates timezone aware.
