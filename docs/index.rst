Welcome to Django OAuth Toolkit Documentation
=============================================

Django OAuth Toolkit is an OAuth 2.0 authorization server for teams already running Django. It
provides, out of the box, the endpoints, models, and logic to issue and manage OAuth2 tokens from
your existing Django project. It can also act as a resource server to protect a Django or Django
REST Framework API. Django OAuth Toolkit makes extensive use of the excellent
`OAuthLib <https://github.com/idan/oauthlib>`_, so that everything is
`rfc-compliant <https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html>`_.

See our :doc:`Changelog <changelog>` for information on updates, and the :doc:`Upgrading <upgrade>`
guide for the breaking changes and steps involved in upgrading between releases.

MCP authorization
-----------------

As of 3.4.0, Django OAuth Toolkit supports the authorization server role required by the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) authorization specification. PKCE is required by default, and the
:doc:`authorization server metadata <oauth2_server_metadata>` (RFC 8414) and
:doc:`protected resource metadata <protected_resource_metadata>` (RFC 9728) discovery endpoints are
included in the default URLconf. :doc:`Dynamic Client Registration <views/dynamic_client_registration>`
(RFC 7591/7592) and :doc:`Client ID Metadata Documents <cimd>` can be enabled with the ``DCR_ENABLED``
and ``CIMD_ENABLED`` settings. See the
`3.4.0 release discussion <https://github.com/django-oauth/django-oauth-toolkit/discussions/1775>`_
for the supported specifications and current gaps.
